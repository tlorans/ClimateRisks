### Market Return 

First approach: relate innovation in continuation utility with the return on the market portfolio (approach followed by EZ).

Second approach: use log linear approximation to express the return on the market portfolio in terms of revisions in expected future aggregate consumption growth: long-run risks literature

Both strategies: we need to relate returns on the market portfolio to continuation utility. 

Major drawback to EZ approach: we don't observe the market portfolio. EZ used the return on an equity index as a proxy, but this is a rather narrow definition.

In response, in recent years empirical work has been based on log-linear approximations, which allow observed consumption growth to replace the unobserved market portfolio return.
