# Net Zero Investing with ChatGPT


```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

In this course, I propose a step-by-step implementation of a net zero strategy with Python, following the methodology proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`, using ChatGPT with the excellent development framework `LangChain` for estimating the underlying data.


This course is calibrated as an introductory course (one-week duration).

The portfolio construction methodology presented here is a direct adaption from Thierry Roncalli's (2023)  {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course and publications. If you want to get a deeper knowledge of some notions in this course, please refer to Thierry Roncalli's course and / or publications.
Any error in this course is mine. 

Unless it is sourced, any opinion expressed in this course is my personnal opinion only. 

Data used for the projects come from [Guillaume Coqueret's github repository](https://github.com/shokru/carbon_emissions).
