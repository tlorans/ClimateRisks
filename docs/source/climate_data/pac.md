## Participation, Ambition and Credibility for an Effective Portfolio Alignment Strategy

### Participation

This dimension of the PAC framework helps to answer the question: is the trend of the issuer in line with the net zero emissions scenario? 

This dimension generally depends on the past observations and corresponds to the track record analysis of historical carbon emissions.

```Python

```

### Ambition 

This dimension answers to the question: is the commitment of the issuer to fight climate change ambitious? In particular, it helps to understand if the target trajector is above, below or in line with the NZE consensus scenario.

This dimension compares the target trajectory on one side and the NZE scenario or the trend on the other side. We measure to what extent companies are willing to reverse their current carbon emissions and have objectives that match the NZE scenario.

```Python
# Figure 9 page 27 ambition
```

### Credibility 

Finally, this last dimension address the most important issue: is the target setting of the issuer relevant and robust? 

Indeed, we may wonder if the target trajectory is a too ambitious promise and a form of greenwashing or a plausible scenario.

We can measure the credibility of the targets by comparing the current trend of carbon emissions and the reduction targets or by analyzing the recent dynamics of the track record.
