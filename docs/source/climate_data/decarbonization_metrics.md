# Decarbonization Metrics

In this part, we follow Le Guenedal et al. (2022) {cite}`le2022net` and proposed carbon metrics by the authors to perform portfolio alignment.

First, we cover the foundations of carbon data and analytics, by defining the concepts of carbon budget, reduction target and trend.

Second, we focus on several metrics proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022), both static and dynamic.

Finally, we addres the Participation, Ambition and Credibility (PAC) framework proposed as an analytic grid that can be use for portfolio alignment.
