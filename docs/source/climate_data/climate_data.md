# Part 2: Advanced Metrics

We've seen in the previous part that a time-proofed climate risk integration strategy involves to improve the self-decarbonization aspect of the portfolio, reflecting the fact that the decarbonization pathway is endogenized rather than coming from successive rebalancements only. 

To improve the self-decarbonization ratio, more advanced metrics than the carbon intensity are needed.

In this part, we cover more advanced metrics proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022) {cite}`le2022net`.

We start by the foundations of carbon metrics, by defining the concepts of carbon budget, reduction target and trend (already introduced in the previous part of this course).

Second, we focus on several advanced metrics proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022), both static and dynamic.
