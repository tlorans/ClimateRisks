# Long-Run Risks

The major drawback of the previous approach (relating the value function to the market return) is that we don't oberve the return on wealth. EZ used the return on an equity index as a proxy, but this is a rather narrow definition.

In response, in recent years, empirical work has been based on log-linear approximations, wich allow observed consumption growth to replace the unobserved market portfolio return.

## Long-Run Risks

Environment featuring "long-run risk", i.e. a persistent changes in consumption growth and stochastic volatility. 

The innovation in their paper was the interaction between nonseparable preferences and long-run risk. Previous researchers had applied EZ preferences, but only in i.i.d. environments. Previous researchers had studied environments with changing consumption growth, but always with time-additive CRRA preferenes, where such growth rate risk is unpriced.
