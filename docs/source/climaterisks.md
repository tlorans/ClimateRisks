# Part 1: Climate Risks Integration Strategies

Climate risks is a hot topic in Finance, from regulators requirements for climate risks stress tests to investors appetite for climate investing. As a future sustainable finance analyst, you will be asked for guidances on climate risks integration strategies. 

The purpose of this part is to give you a brief overview of the main existing strategies for climate risks integration, from the widely implemented low-carbon strategy with fundamental data (carbon intensity) to the enhanced index with market-based data (carbon beta).

Low-carbon strategy corresponds to portfolio's decarbonization, excluding the higher emitting stocks. This strategy is a tool for climate risks hedging if the assumption that carbon risk is not priced by the market holds.

An enhanced index with carbon beta recognizes that carbon risk is, at least partially, priced-in by the market. The purpose of this approach is to measure the sensibility of stocks to the carbon systematic risk and to build a portfolio that is negatively (ie. favoring stocks with positive reaction to carbon risk) loaded towards carbon risk.

We then focus on the puzzling negative returns for the carbon risk factor, and explored the notions of realized vs. expected returns. If expected returns of green assets should be lower than brown assets at equilibrium, unanticipated (by the average investor) shocks to climate concerns can lead to transitory (due to attention shift) green assets outperformance, leading to transitory negative returns for the carbon risk factor.
