# Dynamic Decarbonization

We've seen in the low-carbon strategy framework how investors can conduct a portfolio decarbonization with a static approach. On the other side, net zero investing involves portfolio alignment with a decarbonization pathway, rather than a simple static decarbonization. It involves a dynamic strategy in order to comply with the given net zero scenario.

The dynamic problem is trickier since it involves rebalancing decisions and depends on the future behavior of corporate issuers. 

In this part, we are going to compare the approach for performing a portfolio alignment with the Paris-Aligned Benchmarks (PAB) approach and the net zero emissions (NZE) scenario for 2050.
