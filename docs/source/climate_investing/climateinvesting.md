# Part 1: Climate Investing in Equity Markets

Climate risks is a hot topic in Finance, from regulators requirements for climate risks stress tests to investors appetite for climate investing. As a future sustainable finance analyst, you will be asked for guidances on climate risks integration strategies.

Before the surge of net zero investors, insurers and asset managers alliances, climate investing mainly involved static portfolio decarbonization.

But, as stated by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`, net zero investing has changed the scope of climate investing, as the corresponding strategy cannot be considered as a simple tilt of a business-as-usual portfolio.

Indeed, according to the framework proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022), a net zero portfolio:

- starts with a sound decarbonization pathway of a net zero emissions scenario
- has a dynamic decarbonization dimension, respecting the endogenous aspect of the decarbonization pathway and implying self-decarbonization of the portfolio
- encompasses the transition dimension, to ensure that the portfolio is financing the transition towards a low-carbon economy

The purpose of this part is to give you an overview of the net zero portfolio construction framework proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022), as a robust approach for climate investing. 

Net zero portfolio starts with a net zero emissions scenario, which is a physical concept, based on carbon budget. We will see how to assess a decarbonization pathway compliance to a net zero objective, and how to derive the portfolio's decarbonization (based on carbon intensity) pathway from it. In contrast with a simple static portfolio decarbonization, portfolio alignment with a decarbonization pathway implies a dynamic portfolio decarbonization. We will see how to conduct this dynamic exercice and the corresponding challenges.

Net zero portfolio implies self-decarbonization rather than sequential decarbonization (meaning decarbonization based on rebalancement only). We will see how to determine from which component portfolio's decarbonization comes from, leading to the notion of net zero backtesting. We will see that adding carbon footprint dynamics metric helps in improving the self-decarbonization property of the portfolio.

Finally, the net zero portfolio integrates the transition dimension. We will see how a green intensity measure can help in ensuring that the portfolio contributes to the transition towards a low-carbon economy.
