# Part 1: A Forward-Looking Climate Risk Hedging Strategy

In this first part of this course, we cover a forward-looking climate risk hedging strategy.

Let's first recall our assumptions:
1. Building upon the economics and physics of climate change, we recognize that transition risk, and especially carbon risk is the most immediate climate risk to take into account into equity investing, given the tragedy of the horizon.
2. We will propose a passive climate risk hedging strategy, similar to the one proposed by Andersson et al. (2016) and Roncalli (2023) by minimizing the tracking error relative to a benchmark while reducing the exposure to carbon risk.
3. We propose to recognize the forward-looking nature of a climate risk hedging strategy, by following Barahhou et al. (2022)  {cite:p}`barahhou2022net` approach with the portfolio alignment to a NZE scenario and the corresponding decarbonization pathway.

A forward-looking climate risk hedging strategy starts with a NZE scenario. We will thus cover in the first part how to derive a portfolio decarbonization pathway from a NZE scenario.

The second part of this course introduces the concept of portfolio alignment to a decarbonization pathway, such as the one proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022). It changes the nature of the climate risk hedging strategy, from a static approach to a forward-looking approach.

In a third and final section, we will focus on the concept of self-decarbonization and decarbonization backtesting, to ensure that the resulting portfolio has endogenized the decarbonization pathway, leading to a time-proofed climate risk integration, as advocated by Barahhou et al. (2022).
