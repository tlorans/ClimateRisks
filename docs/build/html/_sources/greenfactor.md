## Green Factor

In the previous part, we've seen how exposure to the systematic carbon risk can be measured with carbon beta, thanks to the BMG factor from Gorgen et al. (2019). We've observed the puzzling results that green assets outperformed brown assets in the previous decade, according to the BMG negative returns.

However, as showed by the equilibrium model from Pastor et al. (2021) {cite:p}`pastor2021sustainable`, green assets should have lower expected returns than brown assets, because:
- some investors have green tastes, and then require lower returns for holding these assets (taste premium)
- greener assets are a better hedge against climate risks (risk premium)

So, how could we explain the negative returns from the BMG factor? Pastor et al. (2021) explain that green assets can have higher realized returns while agents' demand shift unexpectedly in the green direction. Investors' demand for green assets can incease unexpectedly, directly driving up green assets prices. Consumers' demand for green products can also unexpectedly strenghen, driving up green firms' profits and thus stock prices.

Then, a transitory green factor, driven by attention shift, can arise. In this part, we will follow Pastor et al. (2022){cite:p}`pastor2022dissecting` and construct a green factor portfolio.

This green factor portolio potentially benefits from the investors' attention shift.
