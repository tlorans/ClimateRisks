# Net Zero Investing

For investors having a taste for contribution to the global warming mitigation, the default strategy proposed was the low-carbon strategy. However, this approach has many drawbacks in achieving this objective. These serious drawbacks led to greenwashing risks and claims against sustainable finance offering.

Since recent years, net zero investing became a new step in the climate investing world, with more and more robust methodologies to ensure that the resulting portfolio align with the investor taste / objective to contribute to global warming mitigation.

Net zero emissions scenario translated to portfolio decarbonization pathway is a first step towards a robust net zero investing approach. With such a scenario, the investor has a sense of its contribution towards net zero objective, and can check if the portfolio's strategy comply with a climate objective. Unfortunately, the most known decarbonization pathway, Paris-Aligned Benchmarks, doesn't rely on any economic or physical foundations (ie. a sound and robust net zero emissions scenario). The PAB pathway is far more aggressive than a portfolio decarbonization pathway deduced from the IEA net zero emissions scenario.

Based on a decarbonization pathway, net zero portfolio involves dynamic decarbonization, that contrast with the static one proposed by low-carbon strategy. Portfolio alignment in net zero portfolios is based on a reference year, and ensure that the portfolio decarbonization complies with the decarbonization pathway. However, as PAB methodology doesn't include any requirements regarding the carbon footprint dynamics, most of the portfolio's decarbonization comes from sequential decarbonization rather than self-decarbonization. Including carbon footprint dynamics into the net zero portfolio construction allows for improvement in the self-decarbonization ratio.

Finally, an innovation with the construction of net zero portfolio, again compared with the traditional low-carbon strategy, is the introduction of the transition dimension. A net zero portfolio must ensure its contribution towards a low-carbon economy. However, the PAB approach in including the transition dimension, with the climate impact sectors constraint, falls short to fullfill this objective. In fact, the issue is that the decarbonization and the transition dimensions seem to be negatively correlated. An additional constraint on the green intensity of the portfolio is needed to ensure the net zero portfolio alignment with the goal of financing the transition.
