```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

In this course, I propose a step-by-step implementation of a dynamic portfolio decarbonization strategy with Python, following the methodology proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`. Please follow along and try to implement the scripts on your side.

This course is calibrated as an introductory course (one-week duration).

Most of the methodologies presented here are an adaption from Thierry Roncalli's (2023)  {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course and publications. The value added from this course is in the accompanying Python code only.

If you want to get a deeper knowledge of some notions in this course, please refer to Thierry Roncalli's course and / or publications.
Any error in this course is mine. 

Unless it is sourced, any opinion expressed in this course is my personnal opinion only. 

Data used for the projects come from [Guillaume Coqueret's github repository](https://github.com/shokru/carbon_emissions).
