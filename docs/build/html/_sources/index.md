# Climate Investing


```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

In this course, I propose an overview of climate investing, from the climate risks integration strategies to net zero investing, based on Thierry Roncalli's (2023) {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course and publications. Snippets of Python codes accompany this course. Please follow along and try to implement those codes on your side.

This quick overview is by no mean exhaustive, and is calibrated as an introductory course (one-week duration).

Most of this material is an adaption from Thierry Roncalli's (2023) course and publications. The value added from this course is only in the accompanying Python code and the effort to summarize / articulate the various strategies. 

If any doubt in my notations or implementations, please refer to Thierry Roncalli's course and / or publications. If you want to get a deeper knowledge of some notions in this course, please refer to Thierry Roncalli's course and / or publications.
Any error in this course is mine. 

Unless it is sourced, any opinion expressed in this course is my personnal opinion only. 

Projects are calibrated for a short time-period (around 1 hour) and to illustrate some practical refinements. Again, it is by no mean exhaustive and doesn't pretends to lead to a production-ready portfolio. Data used for the projects come from [Guillaume Coqueret's github repository](https://github.com/shokru/carbon_emissions).
