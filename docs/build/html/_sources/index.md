# Climate Risks in Finance


```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

Climate risks is a hot topic in Finance, from regulators requirements for climate risks stress tests to investors appetite for climate investing. As a future sustainable finance analyst, you will be asked for guidances on climate risks integration strategies. 

The purpose of this course is to give you a brief overview of the main existing strategies, from the widely implemented low-carbon strategy to the newest green factor approach.

This quick overview is by no mean exhaustive. While we try to follow a rigourous approach, noteworthy thanks to Roncalli's (2023) {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course, we definitely take a practician approach and do not cover the theoretical fundations.

While a lot of refinements and alternatives can be considered for each strategy, we will focus on the "default" or most widely used approach.
