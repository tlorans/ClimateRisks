# Climate Investing


```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

We propose here a quick overview of climate investing, from climate risks integration strategies to net zero investing.

This quick overview is by no mean exhaustive. While we try to follow a rigourous approach, noteworthy thanks to Roncalli's (2023) {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course, we definitely take a practician approach and do not cover the theoretical fundations.

While a lot of refinements and alternatives can be considered for each methodology, we will focus on the "default" or most widely used approach.
