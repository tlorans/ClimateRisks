# Net Zero Investing with ChatGPT


```{warning}
This course is under heavy development
```

In this course, I propose a step-by-step implementation of a net zero strategy with Python, following the methodology proposed by Barahhou et al. (2022) {cite:p}`barahhou2022net`, using ChatGPT for estimating the underlying data.

Before starting this course, be sure to familiarize yourself with ChatGPT and the open-source development framework `LangChain` by following these excellent tutorials:

1. [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng)
2. [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-building-system)
3. [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain)

This course is calibrated as an introductory course (one-week duration).

The portfolio construction methodology presented here is a direct adaption from Thierry Roncalli's (2023)  {cite:p}`2023:Roncalli` course and publications. If you want to get a deeper knowledge of some notions in this course, please refer to Thierry Roncalli's course and / or publications.
