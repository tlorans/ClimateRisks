# Part 0: Introduction


## Key Takeaways

- Physical risk is expected to occur by the end of the century, while transition risk can occur during the next decade: this is the consequence of the tragedy of horizons, coming from the economics and physics of climate change. Therefore, studies (and this course) focus on transition risk (in fact, carbon risk)

- Portfolio decarbonization has been proposed as a climate risk integration strategy by Andersson et al. (2016). It consists in minimizing the tracking error with the benchmark while reducing the carbon footprint of the portfolio. 

- We know that the objective of potential climate mitigations policies will be to track a NZE scenario. A robust portfolio decarbonization should target portfolio alignment with this NZE scenario, and thus adopt a dynamic approach.
