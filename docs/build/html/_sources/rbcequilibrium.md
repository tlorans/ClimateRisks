# Hansen's RBC Model: Equilibrium Conditions

The objective is to apply the recursive methods to characterize the equilibrium conditions of the basic Hansen's RBC model. 

This part is inspired by the McCandless (2008 {cite:p}`mccandless2008abcs`) chapter 6.

## The Value Function

In a Robinson Crusoe type economy, the one agent maximizes the discounted utility function:

\begin{equation}
\max \sum^{\infty}_{t=0}\beta^t u(c_t, l_t)
\end{equation}

where $c_t$ is time $t$ consumption, and $l_t$ is time $t$ leisure, where $l = 1 - h_t$ and $h_t$ is time $t$ labor.
