# Basics Intuition for Solving for Dynamics

## The Need For Log-Linearization

Equilibrium Conditions from the previous part form a nonlinear rational expectations models. However, we only have methods for solving linear rational expectations models. 

To solve our system, we therefore need to linearize it. We do so by applying the method of log-linearization around the the steady-state.

### Steady-State

### Log-Linearization Around the Steady-State

## The Method of Undetermined Coefficients


### Conjecturing a Linear Recursive Law of Motion

What is given in our system is the state variables at time $t$. We need to find the value of the endogeneous variables in our model.

We can conjecture a linear recursive law of motion.
