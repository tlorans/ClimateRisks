## Emissions Metrics


### Static Measures: Duration, Gap, Slope and Budget

Let's consider a static approach, where $t^*$ is the target horizon. We can denote $CE_i^{NZE}(t^*)$ as the net zero emissions scenario for issuer $i$, with $t_0$ the current date.

We can compute $CE^{NZE}_i(t^*)$ by using the issuer's targets or using a consensus scenario:

\begin{equation}
CE^{NZE}_i(t^*) = (1 - \mathfrak{R}^*(t_0,t^*)) \cdot CE_i(t_0)
\end{equation}

where $\mathfrak{R}^*(t_0,t^*)$ is the carbon reduction between $t_0$ and $t^*$ expected for this issuer. For example, it can be equal to the expected reduction for the sector of the issuer in order to achieve an NZE scenario.
