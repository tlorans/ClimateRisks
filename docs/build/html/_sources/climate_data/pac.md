## Participation, Ambition and Credibility

In this part, we discuss the participation, ambition and credibility (PAC) framework proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022) to assess a company's NZE alignment strategy, based on the quantitative metrics discussed previously. It can forms the basis for a sound stocks selection for net zero investing in part 3.

This framework depends on the carbon trajectories $CE_i(t)$, $CE_i^{Trend}(t)$, $CE^{Target}_i(t)$ and $CE^{NZE}_i(t)$, where $CE_i(t)$ are the historical carbon emissions, $CE_i^{Trend}$ are the estimated carbon emissions forecasted with the trend model, $CE_i^{Target}(t)$ are the deduced carbon emissions form the targets and $CE^{NZE}_i(t)$ is the NZE scenario.
### Participation

The participation dimension generally depends on the past observations and corresponds to the track record analysis of historical carbon emissions.
This dimension helps to answer the question: is the trend of the issuer in line with the net zero emissions scenario?

### Ambition 

This dimension answers to the question: is the commitment of the issuer to fight climate change ambitious? In particular, it helps to understand if the target trajector is above, below or in line with the NZE consensus scenario.

This dimension compares the target trajectory on one side and the NZE scenario or the trend on the other side. We measure to what extent companies are willing to reverse their current carbon emissions and have objectives that match the NZE scenario.

```

### Credibility 

Finally, this last dimension address the most important issue: is the target setting of the issuer relevant and robust? 

Indeed, we may wonder if the target trajectory is a too ambitious promise and a form of greenwashing or a plausible scenario.

We can measure the credibility of the targets by comparing the current trend of carbon emissions and the reduction targets or by analyzing the recent dynamics of the track record.
