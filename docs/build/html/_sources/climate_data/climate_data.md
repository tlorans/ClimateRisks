# Part 2: Advanced Metrics for an Effective Portfolio Alignment Strategy

We've seen in the previous part that a modern approach to climate investing suppose to maximize the self-decarbonization aspect of the portfolio, reflecting the fact that the decarbonization pathway is endogenized rather than coming from annual rebalancement only. 

To improve the self-decarbonization ratio, more advanced metrics than the carbon intensity are needed.

In this part, we cover advanced metrics proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022) {cite}`le2022net`.

We start by the foundations of carbon metrics, by defining the concepts of carbon budget, reduction target and trend (already introduced in the previous part of this course).

Second, we focus on several advanced metrics proposed by Le Guenedal et al. (2022), both static and dynamic.

Finally, we addres the Participation, Ambition and Credibility (PAC) framework proposed as an analytic grid that can be use for portfolio alignment.
