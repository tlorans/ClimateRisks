# Recursive Preferences and Long-Run Risks

The observed level of risk premia and return volatility require a volatile SDF. In CCAPM model, we have seen something of the form:

\begin{equation}
e^{\gamma \sigma^2_g} 
\end{equation}

That requires high volatility of consumption growth ($\sigma^2_g$) or high risk aversion $\gamma$.

Another approach, to give more degree of freedoms with more parameters, is to relax assumption of time-separability utility, such that the marginal utility $u'(c_t)$ would depends on things besides current consumption. It allow to make $u'(c_t)$ much more volatility than consumption growth. 

We are going to focus on the solution with Recursive Preferences. In that case, the marginal utility depends on expected future consumption, and not current consumption only.

## Drawbacks of Time-Additive Preferences

The assumption of time-additive preferences that we've used until now has no compelling theoretical justification. Its widespread use is based solely on mathematical convenience.

Unfortunately, this convenience comes at a cost. Indeed, time-additive / expected utility preferences impose several restrictions.

### Elasticity of Intertemporal Substition and Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion

First, it implies that the Elasticity of Intertemporal Substitution (EIS) is the reciprocal of the Coefficient of Relative Risk Aversion (RRA).

### Market Return 

First approach: relate innovation in continuation utility with the return on the market portfolio (approach followed by EZ).

Second approach: use log linear approximation to express the return on the market portfolio in terms of revisions in expected future aggregate consumption growth: long-run risks literature

Both strategies: we need to relate returns on the market portfolio to continuation utility. 

Major drawback to EZ approach: we don't observe the market portfolio. EZ used the return on an equity index as a proxy, but this is a rather narrow definition.

In response, in recent years empirical work has been based on log-linear approximations, which allow observed consumption growth to replace the unobserved market portfolio return.
